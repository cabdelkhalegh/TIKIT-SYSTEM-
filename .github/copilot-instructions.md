# GitHub Copilot Instructions for TIKIT-SYSTEM

## Project Overview

This repository contains the TIKIT APP - a ticket management system. The project is in its early stages of development.

## General Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow SOLID principles and best practices
- Add meaningful comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Documentation
- Update README.md when adding new features or making significant changes
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Include setup and installation instructions as the project grows

### Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages when applicable

## Development Workflow

### Before Making Changes
- Understand the existing codebase structure
- Check for existing patterns and conventions
- Review related code before implementing new features

### Code Changes
- Make minimal, surgical changes to accomplish the task
- Preserve existing functionality unless specifically asked to change it
- Test changes thoroughly before committing
- Follow the existing code style and patterns in the repository

### Testing
- Add tests for new features when test infrastructure exists
- Run existing tests to ensure no regressions
- Validate changes manually when applicable

## Best Practices

### Security
- Never commit secrets, API keys, or sensitive credentials
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Follow security best practices for the technology stack being used
- Fix security vulnerabilities when discovered

### Performance
- Consider performance implications of code changes
- Optimize database queries and API calls
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms

### Maintainability
- Keep functions and methods focused and concise
- Avoid code duplication - extract reusable components
- Use dependency injection and modular design
- Make code easy to test and extend

## Technology Stack

*To be updated as the project evolves with specific technologies, frameworks, and tools*

## Build and Development Commands

*To be updated as build processes and development workflows are established*

## Additional Notes

- This is a growing project - these instructions will be updated as the codebase evolves
- When in doubt, follow established patterns in the existing code
- Prioritize code quality and maintainability over quick fixes
