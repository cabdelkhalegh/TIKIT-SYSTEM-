## Recommendations
To keep this repository information accurate as the project evolves:
1. Update this file when platform, architecture, or major dependencies change.
2. Ensure frontend and backend READMEs describe their frameworks, tooling, and setup steps.
3. Document database types, migration strategy, and connection configuration in backend docs.
4. Document authentication providers, flows, and security considerations in dedicated auth docs.
5. Maintain deployment documentation (environments, URLs, and CI/CD configuration) alongside infrastructure code.
6. Keep project configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, env/config files) in sync with the documented setup.
